# Getting Started

### Physical architecture:

Antahsagri  is an under-water remotely operated vehicle (ROV), designed to explore the underwater world and collect data for research and analysis. It is equipped with several sensors:

- 6 Thrusters T100
- 6 Basic Esc
- 1 Bar30 pressure sensor
- 2 Leak sensors
- 2 Lumen Subsea Lights
- 1 Raspberry Pi , used as a companion computer
- 1 camera
- 1 servo for the camera tilt
- 1 PixHawk with internal 9 DOF IMU

The small size of the Antahsagri and its high manoeuvrability is perfect to achieve exploration missions in tiny places. Also, its wide variety of sensors make the automation easier.


## Brushing up ROS Skills
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software.ROS is a software suite which allows for quick and easy building of autonomous robotic systems. ROS should be considered as a set of tools for creating new solutions or adjusting already existing ones. A major advantage of this system is a great set of drivers and implemented algorithms widely used in robotics.
First of all, it's a good idea to read through the official ROS [tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) before going forward.
